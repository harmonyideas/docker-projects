Apache Doris is a high-performance, real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, known for its extreme speed and ease of use. 
It is a next-generation real-time data warehouse that can handle large amounts of data quickly and easily.

Here are some of the key features of Apache Doris:
- It is a columnar storage engine, which encodes, compresses, and reads data by column. This makes it very efficient for analytical queries.
- It uses a cost-based optimizer (CBO) to figure out the most efficient execution plan for complicated big queries.
- It has a fully vectorized execution engine so it can reduce virtual function calls and cache misses.
- It is MPP-based (Massively Parallel Processing) so it can give full play to the user's machines and cores.
- In Doris, query execution is data-driven, which means whether a query gets executed is determined by whether its relevant data is ready, and this enables more efficient use of CPUs.
- Doris also provides BitmapIndex to speed up data queries.
- Doris currently adopts a complete column storage structure and provides rich indexes to deal with different query scenarios, laying a solid foundation for Doris's efficient writing and query performance.
